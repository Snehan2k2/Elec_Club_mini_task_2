Ideation of the project "Water level controller":

The project description: ![Water level controller](https://github.com/Snehan2k2/Tasks/blob/master/Arduino%20in%20complex%20circuits/Water%20level%20controller.md)

Problem statement:
The aim is to switch the motor ON when the level of the water drops below certain point, and to switch off the motor when the tank becomes full. If the level in side the sump tank is low, the motor will not be switched ON and a beep sound is generated when the level in the sump tank is low.
Also, the data regarding the quantity of water is displayed on the internet.

Ideation phase:

Aluminium wire => Analog pins on Arduino => Buzzer, LCD display, Motor
